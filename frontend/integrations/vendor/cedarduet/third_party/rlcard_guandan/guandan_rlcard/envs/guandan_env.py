"""RLCard-style environment wrapper for Guandan.

This is an *open* environment: states are plain dicts (no fixed-size
encoding), agents are the player objects themselves, and with
``perfect_info`` (default True) every state also exposes all four hands
plus per-hand step estimates. This makes the whole interaction - deals,
tribute phase, every action - visible and easy to debug, at the price of
not being a drop-in for RLCard's built-in RL agents.

Config keys (all optional):
    seed (int): random seed for the game.
    allow_step_back (bool): accepted for compat; step_back is NOT
        supported by this game.
    perfect_info (bool): include other players' hands in states.
