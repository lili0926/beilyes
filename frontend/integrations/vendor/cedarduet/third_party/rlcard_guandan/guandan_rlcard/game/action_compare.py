"""Action comparison: which legal actions beat the current table action.

This module fixes several rule bugs present in the original
implementation (each fix is marked with a ``RULE`` comment):

1. The four-joker bomb beats everything, including straight flushes and
   bombs with 5+ cards (it used to be filtered out by the bomb-length
   check because it only has 4 cards).
2. A straight flush must be strictly greater to beat another straight
   flush (equal lowest rank used to be accepted).
3. Two-trips (钢板) are sequences and are compared by natural rank; the
   level card is not promoted inside a sequence (a level-rank two-trips
   used to wrongly beat KKKAAA).
