"""Guandan game: ties dealer/judger/player/round together for the env.

Design notes (intentional deviations from stock RLCard, kept from the
original "open" environment):

* ``init_game(players)`` takes the agent objects themselves - agents
  subclass ``GuandanPlayer`` so the full game/agent interaction
  (including the tribute phase) is observable and debuggable.
* States may carry perfect information (every hand) when
  ``perfect_info`` is True; see ``get_state``.
* When the current player has already emptied their hand, the
  environment still asks them to act; the agent must return ``[]``,
  which triggers the wind-follow (接风) bookkeeping in ``step``.
